# Allocating-Advertising-Resources

• The aim of this project was to identify the effects of ads on sales for a product launched four years ago by a cosmetics firm. It also aimed to devise a multi-channel attribution model to optimally allocate advertising resources.

• We ran multiple regressions to derive the lowest AIC as our focal model and we calculated the elasticities for each advertising parameter. Optimal advertising budget allocation per marketing channel is suggested to be proportional to advertising elasticities calculated from the focal model.

• Our final focal model was a multiple regression model using the square root function to captures the carryover effect of advertising and the economic theory of diminishing marginal returns.
